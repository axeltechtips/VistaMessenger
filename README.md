# VistaMessenger
VistaMessenger is a lightweight, open-source messaging application designed for direct communication between computers. Forget email chains and bloated chat platforms - VistaMessenger keeps things simple and secure, focusing on pure peer-to-peer messaging without the internet as the middleman.

# How can I use it on the cloud?
You can use the source code to host it on a preferred server.

# What does this do?
It uses P2P and Realtime networks to message. 

# Credits
Credits to dabit3 for making the original messaging app, I just want to make the messaging community better.
